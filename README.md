So, out matrix T has entries from standard normal distribution. Random projections is a specific method within matrix sketching
that involves projecting the high-dimensional data onto a
lower-dimensional space using a randomly generated matrix, in
such a way that the distances between the points are
approximately preserved according to the Johnson-Lindenstrauss
lemma.

The main advantage is that the projected problem has less computational time with a desired accuracy, what depends on the value of k.
