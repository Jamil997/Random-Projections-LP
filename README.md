So, out matrix T has entries from standard normal distribution. Random projections is a specific method within matrix sketching
that involves projecting the high-dimensional data onto a
lower-dimensional space using a randomly generated matrix, in
such a way that the distances between the points are
approximately preserved according to the Johnson-Lindenstrauss
lemma.
